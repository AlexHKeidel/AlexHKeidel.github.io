# Academic Research (no code)

## Driver Behaviour
The research focusses on exploring novel neural network architectures in combination with computer vision to understand driver behaviour in a video classification context.

Technologies used in my contribution include applied machine learning algorithms (Python - Keras and Tensorflow), applied computer vision algorithms (OpenCV), experiment pipelines, and documentation (LaTeX).

*The code for this project belongs to Edge Hill University and some experiment pipelines may still be used at a later stage and will therefore not be made publically available until results are published.*


## Scenario Viewer MiddleVR & Web API
A contribution towards a research project surrounding 3D graphics, historic parametric modelling, virtual reality, and web services. The
[project website](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/computerscience/research/projects/3d-parametric-modelling/) provides an overview of the history, motivation, and surrounding software. ([Similary projects at Edge Hill](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/computerscience/research/research-centre-groups/cedar/cedar-inspire/))

Technologies used in my contribution include Unity3D (C#), MiddleVR, NodeJS (including a multitude of front-end tools), and MongoDB. The web API software was developed using test driven development and ES6 standard.

You can find a youtube video of the Edge Hill CAVE running an example virtualisation at the bottom of this page.

*The applications are not publically hosted, but if you are interested in running the web-API or contributing to this project please feel free to contact me.
There are plans to create a mobile app, and browser version of the ScenarioViewer which will take advantage of the web API.*

# Personal Projects

## Processing
A little fun project in Processing, a Java based programming language great for quick mock-ups, 2D and 3D animation and simple physics.

[How to hang garlands and audioactive decay (Github repo)](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Processing)

## Shopping List App (Android)
A simple shopping list idea that I started to work on for fun until the built-in Android Memo app started supporting nicer check lists.

[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/ShoppingListApplication)

# University Coursework Projects

## Master's Project
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Initial_Prototype)

A Java based GUI framework for comparing simple neural networks (Multi-layered Perceptrons) with different hidden layer, activation function, and learning algorithm configurations. The aim was to produce an easy to use interface driven program to allow novices (particulary in SME) to produce simple neural networks to test feasability of applying ML to custom problems and data. As a proof of concept the application was applied to a publically available dataset and compared and contrasted a number of different MLP architectures for a classificiation and regression problem. (Year 4)



## NYAS Mobile App (Xamarin C#)
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/NYAS-App)

A mobile application developed in Xamarin (C#) for the [The National Youth Advocacy Service (NYAS)](https://www.nyas.net/). It's features include a custom login pin system, permanent storage, tailored information from NYAS and different ways of contacting NYAS in a secure way directly through the app, all packaged within a UI that is tailored towards children and young teenagers. (Year 2)

## "Music" from Data (Processing)
Three different approaches to generating "music" from data [Github](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Music_from_Data):
* Random vs Perlin noise vs DataSet
* Conway's Game of Life [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* Genetic / Evolutionary Algorithm

...More like bleeps and bloops from data. (Year 4)

## MyMedicare (Android App)
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/MyMedicare)

A local MySQL database driven mobile app for recording blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature readings and built-in functions for contacting your GP when high risk readings are entered.

## Liverpool World Museum Guided Tour App (Android - Group Project)
A group project in which we (a group of 6 second year students) designed, prototyped, developed, and presented a novel QR code reader based museum exhibit exploration mobile app with a focus on interaction game-like learning targeted towards a younger demographic.

My contributions are towards the general code of the application as well as the question screens when completing a tour. (Year 2)

*[**Private** repository](https://github.com/cnicholas63/Risky-Business-Museum-App)*

## Distributed Game of Nim (Java)
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Game_of_Nim)

A distributed client-server Java remote method inovkation (RMI) driven multiplayer (optional CPU using a rules based approach for winning the game, on easy mode there is a random chance the CPU makes a wrong move)game of Nim. The server side of the project supports concurrent games (multi-threading). Players interact with a custom terminal to issue commands such as starting a game and making their moves (given it is their turn). The game logic is implemented on the server to prevent cheating. (Year 3)

## Cluedo Game (C#)
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/CluedoGame)

The game of Cluedo with a computer-science theme. Served as a learning project to apply OOP concepts (year 2).


## Prolog Exercises 
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/PrologExercises)

Logic programming with Prolog, a rule based logic programming language as part of a functional and logic programming module (Year 4)


## Processing Games, Agents, Simple Pysics
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Processing_Portfolio_Exercises)

Portfolio exercises surrounding different concepts, such as 2D physics, agents and steering, velocity and acceleration, etc. encompassed into little games and simulations.


## Memorino (Arduino Board)
Year 2 (Code not yet uploaded)

## FUNctional Programming (Clojure)
Year 4 (Code not yet uploaded)

## First website (HTML/CSS/JS)
[Github repo missing]()
First coursework involving a simple HTML website (1st year)

## BrainMinsa (Arduino Board C++)
Group project for a quiz / simon says / memory training like game, played on an Arduino microcontroller with a built-in joystick and screen.
[Private repository - access can be granted on request](https://github.com/06needhamt/BrainMinsa)

Personal contribution to overall code and a particular state of the main game. Uses common microcontroller programming paradigms such as vectored interrupts and several different input devices (joystick, buttons, potentiometer) and output devices (piezo speaker, screen)

## Augmented Reality Floor Plan (Android Unity C# Vuforia)
[Private Github, request access if desired](https://github.com/cnicholas63/InterfaceMockup)
A group project augmented reality mobile app utilising QR-code markers to provide an augmented reality overview of the Edge Hill University Tech Hub building with interactive information. (Year 4)
