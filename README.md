A Java based GUI framework for comparing simple neural networks (Multi-layered Perceptrons) with different hidden layer, activation function, and learning algorithm configurations. The aim was to produce an easy to use interface driven program to allow novices (particulary in SME) to produce simple neural networks to test feasability of applying ML to custom problems and data. As a proof of concept the application was applied to a publically available dataset and compared and contrasted a number of different MLP architectures for a classificiation and regression problem.
# Academic Research
## Scenario Viewer MiddleVR & Web API
A contribution towards a research project surrounding 3D graphics, historic parametric modelling, virtual reality, and web services.
The original project can be found at https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/computerscience/research/projects/3d-parametric-modelling/

Technologies used in my contribution include Unity3D, MiddleVR, NodeJS (including a multitude of front-end tools), and MongoDB.

## ADD
Technologies used in my contribution include applied machine learning algorithms (Python - Keras and Tensorflow), applied computer vision algorithms (OpenCV), experiment pipelines, and documentation (LaTeX).
