# Academic Research (no code)

## Driver Behaviour (Machine Learning and Computer Vision)
Technologies used in my contribution include applied machine learning algorithms (Python - Keras and Tensorflow), applied computer vision algorithms (OpenCV), experiment pipelines, and documentation (LaTeX).

The code for this project belongs to Edge Hill University and some experiment pipelines may still be used at a later stage and will therefore not be made publically available until results are published.


## Scenario Viewer MiddleVR & Web API
A contribution towards a research project surrounding 3D graphics, historic parametric modelling, virtual reality, and web services. The
[project website](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/computerscience/research/projects/3d-parametric-modelling/) provides an overview of the history, motivation, and surrounding software. ([Similary projects at Edge Hill](https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/computerscience/research/research-centre-groups/cedar/cedar-inspire/))

Technologies used in my contribution include Unity3D (C#), MiddleVR, NodeJS (including a multitude of front-end tools), and MongoDB. The web API software was developed using test driven development and ES6 standard.

You can find a youtube video of the Edge Hill CAVE running an example virtualisation at the bottom of this page.

The applications are not publically hosted but if you are interested in running or contributing to this project please feel free to contact me.
There are plans to create a mobile app, and browser version of the ScenarioViewer which will take advantage of the web API.

# Personal Projects

## Fun with Processing
Some examples of playing around with Processing, a Java based programming language great for quick prototyping 2D and 3D parametric animations and games.

# University Coursework Projects

## Master's Project
[Github Repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/Initial_Prototype)

A Java based GUI framework for comparing simple neural networks (Multi-layered Perceptrons) with different hidden layer, activation function, and learning algorithm configurations. The aim was to produce an easy to use interface driven program to allow novices (particulary in SME) to produce simple neural networks to test feasability of applying ML to custom problems and data. As a proof of concept the application was applied to a publically available dataset and compared and contrasted a number of different MLP architectures for a classificiation and regression problem.


## Augmented Reality Floor Plan (Android Unity C# Vuforia)
[Github repo](link missing)
A group project augmented reality mobile app utilising QR-code markers to provide an augmented reality overview of the Edge Hill University Tech Hub building with interactive information.

## NYAS Mobile App (Xamarin C#)
[Github repo](https://github.com/AlexHKeidel/NYAS-App)

A mobile application developed in Xamarin (C#) for the [The National Youth Advocacy Service (NYAS)](https://www.nyas.net/). It's features include a custom login pin system, permanent storage, tailored information from NYAS and different ways of contacting NYAS in a secure way directly through the app, all packaged within a UI that is tailored towards children and young teenagers.

## "Music" from Data (Processing)
Three different approaches to generating "music" from data [Github](link missing):
* Random vs Perlin noise
* Conway's Game of Life [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* Genetic / Evolutionary Algorithm

...More like bleeps and bloops from data.

## MyMedicare (Android App)
[Github repo](link missing)

A local MySQL database driven mobile app for recording blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature readings and built-in functions for contacting your GP when high risk readings are entered.

## Liverpool World Museum Guided Tour App (Android - Group Project)
A group project in which we (a group of 6 second year students) designed, prototyped, developed, and presented a novel QR code reader based museum exhibit exploration mobile app with a focus on interaction game-like learning targeted towards a younger demographic.
The [repository](link missing) contains example screenshots.
My contributions are towards the general code of the application as well as the question screens when completing a tour.

## Distributed Game of Nim (Java)
[Github repo](link missing)
A distributed client-server Java remote method inovkation (RMI) driven multiplayer (optional CPU using a rules based approach for winning the game, on easy mode there is a random chance the CPU makes a wrong move)game of Nim. The server side of the project supports concurrent games (multi-threading). Players interact with a custom terminal to issue commands such as starting a game and making their moves (given it is their turn). The game logic is implemented on the server to prevent cheating.

## BrainMinsa (Arduino Board C++)
Group project for a quiz / simon says / memory training like game played on an Arduino microcontroller with a built-in joystick and screen.
[Private repository - access can be granted on request](https://github.com/06needhamt/BrainMinsa)

Personal contribution to overall code and a particular state of the main game. Uses common microcontroller programming paradigms such as vectored interrupts and several different input devices (joystick, buttons, potentiometer) and output devices (piezo speaker, screen)

# Prolog Exercises
Logic programming with Prolog [Github repo](link missing])

# Processing
Thanks to the awesome features of OneDrive, my original code has been permanently deleted.
